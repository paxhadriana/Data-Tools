This repository is where I put scripts made to make my life easier when working with data.

# Excel-CSV convert
## Objective
This script is used to extract .csv files from an Excel document's sheets.

## To-Do
- [x] Allow user input to change default/hardcoded source file and destination folder
- [o] Allow user to extract from several sources (Partial: script can now loop and run through sources in succession without ending unless confirmed)
- [ ] Allow user to select specific sheets to extract
- [ ] Allow user to target specific columns within a sheet to extract
